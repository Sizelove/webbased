# webbased
Web-based project for Spring 2018


Notes:

1) The database is not uploaded in  this repo., to be able to use the website properly you should create a database with the same name
and tables witht the same column names as mentioned in the files. (There are 3 core tables, they should  be found relatively easily)

2) There are still some major flaws, particularly on the main page we created. These are JS issues and could be easily fixed with boostrap
or JQuery

3) Remember, I'll be taking down this repo. entirely in early July.
