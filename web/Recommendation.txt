Utsav Phunyal -> A, significant contributions to  CSS/HTML design as well as input on types of functionalities and coding methods
C.J. Edwards -> B, many contributions to HTML/CSS, present when needed but had difficulties being available towards the end of project,
		leaving Utsav and I to cover many issues with the style coding nearing completion. 
Khuong Nguyen -> B, many design contributions, but failed to make broader contributions. Ability to code left something to be desired,
		 but made up for this on style/theme input.
